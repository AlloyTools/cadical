# TODO

As the goal for this solver is to produce a simplified and easy to
understand, easy to change, and easy to analyze CDCL solver, there are two
types of TODO's here.

## Simplifications

First we list things to simplify or to remove.

  - Check again that all the core CDCL features are necessary.

  - Benchmark, configure and simplify preprocessors.

## Additions

Second things are listed related to additional features.
  
  - Add equivalent literal substitution.

  - Add clause elimination procedures.

  - Add clause shrinking procedures.

## General

There should be an ongoing process of refactoring and documenting the code
and in particular remove part of the code which is not used anymore.
