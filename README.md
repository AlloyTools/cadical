# cadical
Radically Simplified Conflict Driven Clause Learning Solver (CDCL)

The goal of CaDiCal is to have a minimalistic CDCL solver,
which is easy to understand and change, while at the same
time not too much slower than state of the art CDCL solvers
if pre-processing is disabled.

Run './configure.sh' and then 'make' to compile 'cadical'.

The lastest version of CaDiCal can be found on github

  http://github.com/arminbiere/cadical

and stable source releases on
